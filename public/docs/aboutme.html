    I am a fourth-year student studying Bachelor Degree of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario.
    <br />
    I have a strong interest in both the frontend and backend of web and mobile app development. On the backend, I have 3 years of experience in Python, 2 year of experience in C/C++, and am proficient with PHP.
    <br />
    On the frontend, I have 3 years of experience in HTML and CSS, am experienced with Bootstrap, jQuery, and other JavaScript libraries. I have also done full-stack development with Clojure and ClojureScript on a Linux machine.
    <br />
    I am also skilled in designing with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. I have strong language skills, both verbal and in writing, developed through Toastmasters workshops and creative writing courses.
    <br />
    In the summer of 2017, I spent three months studying abroad. Travelling throughout Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, I learned about local cultures whilst successfully completing an academic semester. Despite not being fluent in any foreign languages, I was able to adapt to new customs and learn about the historical and cultural significance of many cities.
    <br />
    On my spare time, I like to read books, write novels, and play Dungeons & Dragons.
